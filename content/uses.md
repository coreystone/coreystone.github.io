Inspired by [`uses.tech`](https://uses.tech/), here is some day-to-day tech stuff I use to make my life better, while trying to work towards [digital minimalism](https://calnewport.com/on-digital-minimalism/).

I love finding great FOSS alternatives to proprietary software. 

Dark Mode everywhere.

## Computing

* [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/): everything else
* [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)


## Development
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/): version control
* [GitHub](https://github.com/coreystone): deploying this website and archiving projects

    * Signal's [Note to self feature](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self) is also very convenient for quick sharing
