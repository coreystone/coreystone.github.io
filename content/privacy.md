This is not a privacy "policy", because it's simple: this site does not track you or collect any personal information about you. There are no cookies, and no nonsense.

This site uses "[Umami](https://umami.is/)" for privacy-preserving site analytics as an alternative Google Analytics. It does not collect any personal information, such as IP addresses, so I have no way of knowing
who you are. Here is a link to Umami's [privacy policy](https://umami.is/privacy).

Anonymous site visitor information collected by Umami:
* Browser 
* OS
* Device type (laptop, mobile, desktop, etc.)
* Referrer link domain

This site also implements privacy-respecting [YouTube "embeds"](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/embedding-youtube-in-a-privacy-friendly-way/35784/5), meaning you won't load any content from YouTube's servers until you decide to click on a video, as thumbnails and preview information are hosted by the site. Thanks to [Joost van Der Schee](https://discourse.gohugo.io/u/jhvanderschee/summary).

That's pretty much it. I don't know who visits my site, nor do I want to (no offense). Jokes aside: privacy is important to me, and I try to make everything about this site reflect that.
