I've been writing for years. It's something I've always enjoyed, and something I'm always trying to get better at. 
Yet, until recently I've always been hesitant to share with anyone except my closest friends (this goes for code too).
My mind tricks me into thinking things aren't "ready", which I realized is just insecurity disguised as a vain attempt at chasing "perfection". 

Only having accepted this a few weeks ago, it's still something I'm working on. That's why an idea I recently stumbled upon resonated with me so much:
[digital gardening](https://www.genei.io/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-digital-gardens), which is a "newly revived philosophy for publishing personal knowledge on the web."  It's been developing over the last few years which challenges how we think about the typical "blog website", focusing on cultivating and capturing progress and knowledge rather than displaying a final product, 
as is typical with blogs that show posts in a static, reverse-chronological order.

The first stop and required reading on this topic is Maggie Appleton's [brief history & ethos](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) of digital gardening.

She lays out six key principles that separate a digital garden from a traditional blog, emphasizing continuous, topographical growth while not being afraid to 
show your imperfections as part of a playful, personal, and experimental learning process. As someone that worries too much about a final product and sometimes sets unrealistic 
standardsm, this is a refreshing and exciting idea.

I also recommend watching [Wanderloots](https://wanderloots.xyz/)'s [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en56OKg5hyc) on the topic where he also shows some examples.

Appleton describes a tiered-approach to publishing content, using tongue-in-cheek gardening metaphors with "seedling", "budding", "evergreen" to describe
content that is increasingly fleshed-out and refined. For my own use case, I'm thinking about just going with something like *idea* < *note* < *post*.
For now, I'm just sticking with "notes" for short-form, less developed content, and "posts" for more traditional essays and articles (ie, a blog post).

That's pretty much it for now. I'm not trying to overcommit to anything or make empty promises like writing X amount per week, because that really goes against the point of all of this.
I'm just trying to use this as a tool to help *me* by documenting the things I'm learning and thinking about.
