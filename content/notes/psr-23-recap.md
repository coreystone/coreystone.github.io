## Arriving in San Diego
On October 3, I arrived in San Diego to attend IAPP's Privacy. Security. Risk. conference for the next few days, right along the Marina in Downtown.

The first day I tourist-ed around Coronado Island and the historical Gaslamp Quarter. 

Any trip to San Diego is remiss without trying local craft beer (there is a ton of it) and Baja-style fish tacos. And that's exactly what I did at [Coronado Brewing Co.](https://coronadobrewing.com/)

Across from the conference, there's also the iconic [Kansas City Barbeque](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kansas-city-barbeque-san-diego), which is known as the  "Top Gun Bar" where the dive bar scene in the movie was filmed. Here's a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/7T4mk3Uhzyc?t=781) that walks through all of the locations in San Diego which were featured in Top Gun.

## Privacy engineering forum
I attended the Privacy Engineering Section Forum which featured talks and workshops throughout the day. Some topics included:
* Data clean rooms 
  * Becoming increasingly popular and necessary as third-party cookies approach deprecation and Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) are being blocked by new  tools like iOS 14.5's [App Tracking Transparency](https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to)
* Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), such as:
  * Private set intersection (PSI) (A.K.A, double encryption), multi-party computation (MPC)
  * Pseudonymization and anonymization techniques like K-anonymity, differential privacy
  * Synthetic data
* Re-identification risks and attacks against anonymization
* Consent beyond cookies
* Generative AI

It was really validating to see so many people that are also interested in this stuff, and are actually using these things in their day-to-day to build out real privacy programs, and not just compliance programs.

Privacy can also get really technical and academic, really fast. Differential privacy and k-anonymity, for example, are rooted in mathematical proofs that come from academia. There were definitely some points were I noticed I wasn't the only one in the room that felt overwhelmed or even lost. But that's an important part of the learning process, and should serve to motivate, not discourage.

This forum was easily my favorite part of the conference because of its content and the more intimate, tableside setting compared to the general talks with hundreds of people in a room.


## The rest of the conference
This was my first privacy conference and I loved it. I learned a lot, but more importantly, learned how much I *don't* know.

Here are some of my general takeaways:
* It seems like all anybody can talk about is gen AI-- it was the theme of the conference for this year, to be fair, but it was too much at times
* When people aren't talking about AI, they're talking about PETs
  * One panel even-- ironically-- introduced themselves with their favorite PETs
* People love getting free swag for their kids (Minecraft swords were a common sight)
* Everyone is there for the same reason - and generally very open to chatting with new people (I believe this is what they call... *networking*)
* You're never going to be able to see *all* the talks that you want to, which is more incentive to meet more people who can fill you in on what you missed

Intesresting discussions:
* Google's [Privacy Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Sandbox)
  * The deprecated Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), replaced by Topics API, which is still "[unambiguously harmful](https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/7-googles-topics-api/)"
* Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are *so private* that adhering to regulation becomes difficult
  * [zk-SNARKs](https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/)
  * [Panther Protocol](https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther)

## Next time
What would I do differently next conference? First of all: no ragrets, [not even a single letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjkLKKgOMRY).
* Talk to more people, ask what they're doing and what challenges they're facing at work
* Take *fewer* notes, *listen* more; write down interesting ideas/terms to research later
* Dress more casual; even business casual was too much (*business casual* and fashion standards in the workplace are becoming so helplessly nebulous that I don't even know what they mean anymore)

In the future, I'd also love to attend either of the [USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/) privacy conferences:
* [Privacy Engineering Practice and Respect](https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr23) (PEPR)
* [Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2023) (SOUPS)

*A brisk, foggy night in Downtown San Diego to end the conference.*
