* Everything here serves me as an outlet to muse and to learn more about techology, privacy, and whatever else interests me.
* This site is [**statically generated**](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), meaning what you see is exactly what you get. There are no cookies or other nonsense to worry about. There are tons of cool generators out there like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) that I want to look into, but Hugo just works for me.
  * This allows the site to stay very lightweight and reduce my carbon footprint *(virtue signal)*. Only 0.01g of CO<sub>2</sub> is [produced per site visit](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/coreyst-one/). Shoutout to [Aram Zucker-Scharff](https://aramzs.xyz/) for this idea.
* I am using the [PaperModX](https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX/) theme, courtesy of [Xiao Meng (@reorx)](https://reorx.com/).
* I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host my site as [coreystone.github.io](https://github.com/coreystone/coreystone.github.io). It's simple enough and gets the job done,
though I know in the future I will look into other options.
* I use [Umami](https://umami.is/) for privacy-preserving site analytics. Umami is [GDPR compliant](https://umami.is/blog/gdpr-compliant-website-analytics) and does not collect IP addresses or any other personal information. Read Umami's privacy policy [here](https://umami.is/privacy). Currently I use their free cloud-hosted option just because it works.
* My domain registrar is [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), which I also use to secure the domain with [DNSSEC](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dnssec/how-dnssec-works/) via Cloudflare ([verification](https://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com/coreyst.one)).

Whether or not they will actually respect this is to be seen.
