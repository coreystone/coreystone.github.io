      <title>P.S.R. &#39;23: a recap</title>

      <description>What I learned and saw at Privacy. Security. Respect. 2023.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="arriving-in-san-diego">Arriving in San Diego</h2>
<p>On October 3, I arrived in San Diego to attend IAPP&rsquo;s Privacy. Security. Risk. conference for the next few days, right along the Marina in Downtown.</p>
<p>The first day I tourist-ed around Coronado Island and the historical Gaslamp Quarter.</p>
<p>Any trip to San Diego is remiss without trying local craft beer (there is a ton of it) and Baja-style fish tacos. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did at <a href="https://coronadobrewing.com/">Coronado Brewing Co.</a></p>

<p>Across from the conference, there&rsquo;s also the iconic <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/kansas-city-barbeque-san-diego">Kansas City Barbeque</a>, which is known as the  &ldquo;Top Gun Bar&rdquo; where the dive bar scene in the movie was filmed. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://youtu.be/7T4mk3Uhzyc?t=781">YouTube video</a> that walks through all of the locations in San Diego which were featured in Top Gun.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-engineering-forum">Privacy engineering forum</h2>
<p>I attended the Privacy Engineering Section Forum which featured talks and workshops throughout the day. Some topics included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data clean rooms
<ul>
<li>Becoming increasingly popular and necessary as third-party cookies approach deprecation and Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) are being blocked by new  tools like iOS 14.5&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to">App Tracking Transparency</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), such as:
<ul>
<li>Private set intersection (PSI) (A.K.A, double encryption), multi-party computation (MPC)</li>
<li>Pseudonymization and anonymization techniques like K-anonymity, differential privacy</li>
<li>Synthetic data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Re-identification risks and attacks against anonymization</li>
<li>Consent beyond cookies</li>
<li>Generative AI</li>
</ul>

<p>It was really validating to see so many people that are also interested in this stuff, and are actually using these things in their day-to-day to build out real privacy programs, and not just compliance programs.</p>
<p>Privacy can also get really technical and academic, really fast. Differential privacy and k-anonymity, for example, are rooted in mathematical proofs that come from academia. There were definitely some points were I noticed I wasn&rsquo;t the only one in the room that felt overwhelmed or even lost. But that&rsquo;s an important part of the learning process, and should serve to motivate, not discourage.</p>
<p>This forum was easily my favorite part of the conference because of its content and the more intimate, tableside setting compared to the general talks with hundreds of people in a room.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest-of-the-conference">The rest of the conference</h2>
<p>This was my first privacy conference and I loved it. I learned a lot, but more importantly, learned how much I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> know.</p>
<p>Here are some of my general takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems like all anybody can talk about is gen AI&ndash; it was the theme of the conference for this year, to be fair, but it was too much at times</li>
<li>When people aren&rsquo;t talking about AI, they&rsquo;re talking about PETs
<ul>
<li>One panel even&ndash; ironically&ndash; introduced themselves with their favorite PETs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People love getting free swag for their kids (Minecraft swords were a common sight)</li>
<li>Everyone is there for the same reason - and generally very open to chatting with new people (I believe this is what they call&hellip; <em>networking</em>)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re never going to be able to see <em>all</em> the talks that you want to, which is more incentive to meet more people who can fill you in on what you missed</li>
</ul>
<p>Intesresting discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Sandbox">Privacy Sandbox</a>
<ul>
<li>The deprecated Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), replaced by Topics API, which is still &ldquo;<a href="https://brave.com/web-standards-at-brave/7-googles-topics-api/">unambiguously harmful</a>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are <em>so private</em> that adhering to regulation becomes difficult
<ul>
<li><a href="https://z.cash/learn/what-are-zk-snarks/">zk-SNARKs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther">Panther Protocol</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the official agenda and past talks/slides for the conference <a href="https://iapp.org/conference/past-conferences/PSR23/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="next-time">Next time</h2>
<p>What would I do differently next conference? First of all: no ragrets, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjkLKKgOMRY">not even a single letter</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk to more people, ask what they&rsquo;re doing and what challenges they&rsquo;re facing at work</li>
<li>Take <em>fewer</em> notes, <em>listen</em> more; write down interesting ideas/terms to research later</li>
<li>Dress more casual; even business casual was too much (<em>business casual</em> and fashion standards in the workplace are becoming so helplessly nebulous that I don&rsquo;t even know what they mean anymore)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, I&rsquo;d also love to attend either of the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> privacy conferences:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr23">Privacy Engineering Practice and Respect</a> (PEPR)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2023">Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security</a> (SOUPS)</li>
</ul>
